#  Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.

# Arithmetic Operators :  Arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common mathematical operations:
#   [ Addition(+), Substraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(/), Module(%), Exponentiation(**), Floor division(//) ]


# x =4
# y =5
# z = x+y
# print("addition of 4 and 5 = ", z)

# a = 5
# b = 3
# c = a-b
# print ("Substraction of 5 and 3 =", c)

# as it is many more  


# Assignment Operators : 
# Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables:
#   [ =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=, &, |, ^=, >>=, <<= ]


# Comparison Operators :
# Comparison operators are used to compare two values:
#   [ Equal(=), Not Equal(!=), Greater than(>), Smaller than(<), Greater than or Equal to(>=), Greater than or Equal to(<=)]




# Logical Operators :  
# Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements:

# m = 7
# n = 8
# o = 9
# print((m<n) and (n>m))
# print(m>n or  n<m)
# print(not m>n)



# Identity Operators :
# Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location:


# is 
x = 4
if(type(x) is int):
    print("Correct");
else:
    print("Incorrect");

# is not 
u = 7.7
if(type(u) is not int):
    print("Correct");
else:
    print("Incorrect");


#  Membership Operators :
# Membership operators are used to test if a sequence is presented in an object:






# Bitwise Operators :
# Bitwise operators are used to compare (binary) numbers:
